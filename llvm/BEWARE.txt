These patches are only and ONLY for port Wine3D LLVMpipe driver to Windows 9x!
================================================================================
These patches remove some file system functionality (which doesn't work at all,
because is full in Unicode and on Windows 9x systems these functions are only
empty calls). It also remove random number generator (replacing with very simple
pseudo-random) which could lead to serious security issues on reckless usage!
